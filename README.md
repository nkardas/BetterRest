# BetterRest: Sleep Prediction App

## Overview
BetterRest is a SwiftUI project that integrates machine learning to help users determine the optimal time to go to bed. By leveraging Core ML, the app predicts sleep needs based on user inputs such as wake-up time, desired sleep duration, and caffeine intake.

## Features
- **User Input**: Allows users to enter their desired wake-up time and sleep duration using `DatePicker` and `Stepper`.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes a trained Core ML model to predict optimal bedtime based on user data.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Provides immediate feedback on sleep recommendations.
- **Customizable Interface**: Uses SwiftUI components to create an intuitive and interactive user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **SwiftUI**: For building the user interface.
- **Core ML**: To integrate machine learning models for sleep prediction.
- **Create ML**: For training the sleep prediction model.

## What I Learned
This project enhanced my understanding of:
- Integrating machine learning models into SwiftUI applications.
- Using SwiftUI components like `Stepper` and `DatePicker` for user input.
- Handling data formatting with `DateFormatter` for accurate predictions.

By completing this project, I gained valuable experience in combining SwiftUI with machine learning to create practical applications.

## Conclusion
BetterRest is an innovative app that demonstrates the seamless integration of machine learning into SwiftUI projects. It provides a practical solution for optimizing sleep schedules, showcasing the potential of combining modern UI frameworks with advanced data analysis techniques.
